## About The Project

This project was made because the install process of HolaClient was "difficult". It includes a silent install (basically hides all messages except necessary ones), and possibly more features to come.

## Built With

* [Shell/Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
with the help of:
* [parkervcp's node.js egg](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/generic/nodejs)

## Getting Started

This section will show you how to install this egg.

### Prerequisites

For this, you need:
* [Pterodactyl with a Wings instance](https://pterodactyl.io)
* that's all???

### Installation

1. Download the egg from https://github.com/ItzBenoitXD/holaclient-installer/releases
2. Upload the egg and install it in your Pterodactyl panel.
3. Create a server with the egg and wait the server to finish the installation.
4. Configure the `settings.json` file and start your server!

## Usage

This egg is meant to be used for:
* Server Hostings
* Anything that wants a resource-based system
